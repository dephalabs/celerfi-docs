## Understanding the Discover Page
The discover page majorly consists of a table with many columns. The columns are explained in this section.

- **Token**: The token column gives you access to the names of recently created tokens and the profile of their creators or communities such as their website, X (formerly Twiter) account, Telegram, and Discord channels if available.

- **Created**: This column simply tells you the time each token was created.

- **Liquidity**: The liquidity column tells you the amount of funds available in the token's trading pool to enable buying and selling without causing significant price changes.

- **MarketCap**: This shows the market capitalization of each token. The market capitalizaion of a token is simply the measure of the total value of the token in circulation.

- **Volume**: The volume column shows you how much a specific token has been traded in the past 1, 6, and 24 hours timeframe.

- **CelerFi Audit**: The CelerFi Audit column shows you the level of trustworthiness of each token, calculated by our AI. It contains the following values:
    - **MAD (Malicious Activity Detection)**: This indicates if the token or its associated contract shows sign of malicious activities such as scam patterns.
    - **FAD (Fair Activity Detection)**: FAD tells you the level of fairness or legitimacy of the token's activities, such as avoiding pump-and-dump schemes.
    - **LB (Liquidity Boost)**: The LB tells you the status of the token's liquidity. This will let you know if there's enough liquidity for buying and selling without extreme slippage.

- **Quick Buy**: This column allows you to buy a token.
