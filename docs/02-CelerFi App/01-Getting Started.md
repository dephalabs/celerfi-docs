# Getting Started With CelerFi
Getting started with CelerFi follows a unique process designed to reward community participation and ensure smooth onboarding. Follow these steps to join the waitlist and gain access to CelerFi's dashboard.

## Step 1: Join the Waitlist
CelerFi operates on a community-first model, starting with a telegram-based waitlist. This approach ensures active participation of community members is rewarded. <br/>
To join the telegram waitlist, head over to CelerFi's **[official telegram bot](https://t.me/XcelerBetaBot)**. Alternatively, you can search for **@XcelerBetaBot** via the telegram search feature.

## Step 2: Perform Tasks to Earn Points
To gain access to the CelerFi dashboard, you need to rank high on the dashboard by earning points. The CelerFi telegram bot will provide you with daily tasks to earn points. You can also use your referral link to invite friends. Use the `referral` command on the telegram bot to get your referral link. <br/>
To view your position on the leaderboard, use the `position` command.

## Step 3: Accessing the Dashboard
When you earn enough points on the telegram bot, you will be given a unique link that grants you access to the CelerFi dashboard. Use this link each time you need to access the dashboard.

Your dashboard link is unique to you. Ensure you keep it safe to prevent unauthorized access to your account.
